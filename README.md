http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html

### Data analysis:
1) Which stations has the most number of units?  
2) What is the total number of entries & exits across the subway system for Febuary 1, 2013?  
3) Let's define the busy-ness as sum of entry & exit count. What statioon was the busiest on Feburary 1, 2013? What turnstile was the busiest on that date?  
4) What stations have seen the most usage growth/decline in 2013?  
5) What dates are the least busy? Could you identify days on which stations were not operating at full capacity or closed entirely?  
Bonus)  What hour is the busiest for station CANAL ST in Q1 2013?


### Visualization:
1) Plot the daily row counts for data files in Q1 2013.  
2) Plot the daily total number of entries & exits across the system for Q1 2013.  
3) Plot the mean and standard deviation of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q1 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.  
4) Plot 25/50/75 percentile of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q1 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.  
5) Plot the daily number of closed stations and number of stations that were not operating at full capacity in Q1 2013.
